# Wordle Game

A fun and interactive Wordle clone built with React, featuring a sleek glassmorphism-inspired UI and responsive design.


## Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** Classic Wordle mechanics with tile animations and keyboard feedback.

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for play on both desktop and mobile devices.

* **Stylish UI:** Modern glassmorphism design with dynamic gradient background.

* **Clear Messaging:** Provides feedback for invalid words, not enough letters, and game outcomes.

* **Customizable:** Easy to modify word lists and styling.

## How to Play

1. **Guess the WORDLE in 6 tries.**

2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word. Hit the "ENTER" button (or your keyboard's Enter key) to submit.

3. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word:

   * **Green (e.g., W):** The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.

   * **Orange (e.g., I):** The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.

   * **Gray (e.g., X):** The letter is not in the word in any spot.
     
4. If you guess the word correctly, a green "Congratulations!" message will appear.

5. If you run out of guesses, a red "Game Over!" message will appear, revealing the word.

6. Click "Play Again" to start a new round!
